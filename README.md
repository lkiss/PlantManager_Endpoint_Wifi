# PlantManager_Endpoint_Wifi

This project is an augmentation for PlantManager_Endpoint because this code is for ESP-12E to make the arduino nano or pro mini communicate via http. 
The communication between the 2 boards is serial. With this wifi module it is possible to configure the whole system remotely.
